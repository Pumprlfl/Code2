Ballerburg:  

Classes:  

Questions to ask when creating a class:  

what does it have?(attributes)  
what can it do?(methods)  
what does it know?(outside information)  
who holds it?  
what is it??  

https://jirkadelloro.github.io/EIA2-Inverted/L09_Classes/  
put classes in seperate files with "export class ClassName"  
classes to be used in the same program must use the same namespace
properties declared in constructor can be given _property? to only use them if needed  
null: represents absence of any object value and is treated as falsy(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy)


Oldmacdonald:

when counting through an array < not <=  
when counting through an Array with < of for example 3 it counts 0, 1, 2 which are 3 numbers   
when counting with <= it counts 0, 1, 2, 3 and prints an error message because there are only three objects in the array
