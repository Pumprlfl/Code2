Diary Code 2 Christian Bauer  

General:

for of loops, get the values of the Array  
for in loops, get the key/index of the Array 

Ballerburg:  

Classes:  

Questions to ask when creating a class:  

what does it have?(attributes)  
what can it do?(methods)  
what does it know?(outside information)  
who holds it?  
what is it??  

Things to consider when creating classes:  

use one file per class and write export infront of the class in order for it to be used in other parts of the program  
name the files containing the classes the same as the class  
and refer to them in the html file (defer will work as well, use with all the scripts just to be safe)  
consider the order in which the scripts are listed when refering the classes to each other  
constructor:  



https://jirkadelloro.github.io/EIA2-Inverted/L09_Classes/  
put classes in seperate files with "export class ClassName"  
classes to be used in the same program must use the same namespace
properties declared in constructor can be given _property? to only use them if needed  
null: represents absence of any object value and is treated as falsy(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy)

Oldmacdonald:

when counting through an array < not <=  
when counting through an Array with < of for example 3 it counts 0, 1, 2 which are 3 numbers   
when counting with <= it counts 0, 1, 2, 3 and prints an error message because there are only three objects in the array  
call functions from subclasses in Superclass to utilise them when calling the Animals from the Array
